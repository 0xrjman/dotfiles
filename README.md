# ðŸš€ dotfiles

My personal dev environment, supercharged with `make`.

## Quick Start

```sh
make grant
make install
```

## Usage

Everything is managed via `Makefile`.

- `make install`: Installs all configurations.
- `make install-<app>`: Installs a specific app config (e.g., `make install-nvim`).
- `make help`: Shows all available commands.

Just dive into the `Makefile` for more details.
